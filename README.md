# nonogram15by15
nonogram auto-filling program that prints out "a line" checked where pixels are covered forward and backward (15x15)

Example : in 15x15 puzzle, choose one line you want to fill automatically. (It only takes one line for input, so it is not complete line of course, and you should do it manually)
          for instance, you chose the line "1 2 3 4"
          then you should input each number and type 'r' for closing the input phase
          in that case, you'll have "XXXXXXXOXXXOOXX" as a result.
          now you can fill the pixel where O is there.
